# FENtoSpeak
take a chess FEN file and have it read off the current position in an MP3

You can (hypothetically) add any number of FEN to the FEN.txt file, seperated by a carriage return.
You'll need to be sure you have a the /Audio Files folder with the included delay handlers.
Run the script and it will generate FEN_#, in the order that they are in the text file.

Feel free to take/modify/clean up.  I am a hardware guy with trash coding skills, so feel free to make it better.
